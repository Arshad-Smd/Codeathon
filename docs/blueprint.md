- Accent color: Pale Gold (#D4A273), adding a touch of elegance and highlighting key interactive elements without overwhelming the user.
- Font Pairing: 'Roboto' (sans-serif) for headings to maintain readability and 'Open Sans' (sans-serif) for body text to ensure a clean and accessible reading experience. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use minimalist, outline-style icons for the event timeline milestones and contact details. Subtle Super Mario-themed accents can be incorporated for headings and CTAs, maintaining a sophisticated overall aesthetic.
- Parallax scrolling effect with the 3D Super Mario character animation triggered by scroll position, or implement a mini-game style interaction. Content blocks with a layered, depth-enhanced effect to mimic 3D space.
- Subtle transitions and animations for loading sections, opening dropdowns, and hover effects on interactive elements, creating a seamless, engaging user experience without being overly flashy.
